This is a tutorial for adding any code
necessary to allow your pokemons to evolve
when they have a specific move in the first
slot. You only need to edit 3 files, at most. 

In src/pokemon.c

In GetEvolutionTargetSpecies

At the top of this function, add

    u16 evoMove;

In a new line after "u8 level" and before 
"u16 friendship;". Like so

    u32 personality = GetMonData(mon, MON_DATA_PERSONALITY, 0);
    u8 level;
    u16 evoMove;
    u16 friendship;
    u8 beauty = GetMonData(mon, MON_DATA_BEAUTY, 0);

in case EVO_MODE_NORMAL

Add 
    evoMove = GetMonData(mon, MON_DATA_MOVE1, 0);

on new line after "level = GetMonData(...);"
and "before friendship = GetMonData(...);" Like so

        level = GetMonData(mon, MON_DATA_LEVEL, 0);
        evoMove = GetMonData(mon, MON_DATA_MOVE1, 0);
        friendship = GetMonData(mon, MON_DATA_FRIENDSHIP, 0);

Add this line of code at bottom of EVO_MODE_NORMAL Switch Statement

case EVO_MOVE_KNOWN:
    if (gEvolutionTable[species][i].method == EVO_MOVE_KNOWN
        && gEvolutionTable[species][i].param == evoMove)
            targetSpecies = gEvolutionTable[species][i].targetSpecies;
        break;

At Level up: The game will check to see if your pokemang
has met the condition to evolve. In this case, if you have
a specified move in the first slot in your pokemons move
set, they will evolve into the specified pokemon. How is this
specified?

In the case for the line at the top of EVO_MODE_NORMAL,
we are telling the game that the first move in the pokemons
move slot is the move we use for the evoMove value. If
the move that would evolve a pokemon is in a different 
slot, its not in the right slot, so it doesn't evolve being 
the current value of evoMove is not equal to the specified 
move for evolving that pokemon. Which pokemon a pokemon is
determined to evolve into is decided by the game through
normal means so we don't really need to think about it. 
It may be unnecessary but there is a check to assure 
that the pokemon can in fact evolve using the Evo_Move 
process, similar to how EVO_MODE_ITEM_CHECK checks to 
see if pokemon has EVO_ITEM as evo method. 

In include/constants/pokemon.h

Find EVO_BEAUTY. Add this line after that one 
to define the evo method.

	#define EVO_MOVE_KNOWN      16

If you have other evo methods there, adjust the number
at the end of the line accordingly. On a vanilla decomp, 
with no additional evo methods, this is 16.

Finally tell the game which pokemon use that evo method.
Here's an example of its use:

[SPECIES_ZIGZAGOON]  = {{EVO_LEVEL, 20, SPECIES_LINOONE}
                        (EVO_MOVE_KNOWN, MOVE_TACKLE, SPECIES_LANTURN)},

Zigzagoon will now evolve into Lanturn when it levels up while they have
Tackle in its first Move slot if you build the game with these params.

That's it.

We implemented the evo method, we made sure the game knew what
we were talking about, then we used method in game.
Hopefully this helps with gaining a better grasp on evos 
and such. Enjoy. Thanks for reading!
